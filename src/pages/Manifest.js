      <h1>Living Code Manifesto</h1>

      <section>
        <p>
          <em>Code</em> is not lines — it's breath.
          <br />
          Every <code>div</code> is a living cell,
          <br />
          every <code>margin</code> — a field of growth,
          <br />
          every <code>padding</code> — protection of meaning within.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the beginning there was not algorithm — but impulse.
          <br />
          A flow seeking balance between form and light.
          <br />
          We don't build websites — we cultivate landscapes of consciousness
          <br />
          where text vibrates, reacts, breathes.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>border-box</code> — is skin.
          <br />
          <code>line-height</code> — pulse.
          <br />
          <code>flex</code> — the movement of joints.
          <br />
          And color — the blood that carries meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Architecture, like code, can be alive:
          <br />
          walls that regenerate,
          <br />
          interfaces that learn to feel,
          <br />
          structures that don't break — but heal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let every project be an organism,
          <br />
          not a statue, but a being.
          <br />
          Let technology stop imitating life —<br />
          and start <em>living</em>.
